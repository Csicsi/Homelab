# Homelab Infrastructure Project

A production-like DevOps learning environment built on real hardware, focusing on automation, containerization, and infrastructure as code.

---

## Overview

This homelab serves as a practical platform for learning and demonstrating DevOps and platform engineering skills. The project emphasizes reproducible infrastructure, configuration as code, and production-ready workflows on self-hosted hardware.

**Key focus areas:**

- Configuration management and automation (Ansible)
- Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
- CI/CD pipeline development (Jenkins)
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform)
- Monitoring and observability (Prometheus, Grafana)
- Network services (VPN, reverse proxy, DNS filtering)

---

## Current Infrastructure

### Hardware

**Compute (x86 Architecture):**

- **homelab-main** (192.168.8.10) - ThinkPad T440 - **OFFLINE** pending OS reinstall, future production server
- **homelab-staging** (192.168.8.11) - Asus X550C - **ACTIVE** temporarily handling production traffic
- **homelab-mgmt** (192.168.8.12) - MiniPC (Celeron, 8GB RAM) - **PLANNED** management/CI-CD node

**Compute (ARM Architecture):**

- 2x Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM) with M.2 SSD storage via Geekworm X862 expansion boards - **ONLINE** running observability services
- 1x Raspberry Pi 3B+ for lightweight utilities - **ONLINE** running Homer dashboard and Pi-hole

**Networking:**

- Netgear GS308EP managed PoE+ switch
- GL.iNet SF1200 router (OpenWrt-based, VLAN-capable)
- Evodata PoE hats powering all Raspberry Pis

**Physical Infrastructure:**

- Custom rack built from 2020/2040 aluminum extrusions
- Planned 3D-printed cable management and mounting solutions

### Software Stack

**Core Technologies:**

- **OS:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (x86 hosts), Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (ARM nodes)
- **Automation:** Ansible for configuration management and provisioning
- **Containers:** Docker and Docker Compose
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins (planned for management node)
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx (planned)
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus + Grafana (running on Pis)
- **VPN:** WireGuard server on router
- **DNS/Ad-Blocking:** Pi-hole (running on Pis)
- **Service Dashboard:** Homer (running on Pis)

**Infrastructure as Code:**

- Ansible playbooks for all system configuration
- Dockerfiles and Compose manifests for service deployment
- Terraform for future cloud and hybrid deployments

## Architecture Decisions

### Three-Tier Server Design

The x86 infrastructure follows a three-tier separation of concerns:

**Management Node (homelab-mgmt @ .12):**

- Dedicated to DevOps tooling and infrastructure management
- **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipelines with Docker-in-Docker
- **Portainer** for container orchestration UI
- **Docker Registry** for private image storage
- Isolated from production workloads to prevent build jobs from impacting services

**Staging Node (homelab-staging @ .11):**

- Test deployment target for CI/CD pipelines
- Mirror of production environment for pre-release testing
- Currently serving production traffic while main is offline
- Will return to staging role when production is restored

**Production Node (homelab-main @ .10):**

- Currently offline pending OS reinstall
- Future home for stable production workloads
- Resource-intensive applications (databases, app servers)
- Public-facing services with reverse proxy

**Current Status:**

- **Pis:** Operational - Running Grafana, Prometheus, Homer, Pi-hole
- **Staging:** Active - Handling production traffic temporarily
- **Management:** Planned - MiniPC awaiting setup
- **Main:** Offline - Pending OS reinstall

### Kubernetes Strategy

The project will introduce Kubernetes through k3s (lightweight k8s) on the Raspberry Pi 4 cluster:

- Pi4s provide persistent SSD storage suitable for etcd and workload data
- Separation of concerns: k3s for orchestration learning, x86 hosts for resource-intensive services
- Progression path: standalone k3s cluster → optional mixed-architecture cluster → cloud migration

**Rationale:** This approach balances learning objectives with operational stability. Resource-heavy tasks (Jenkins builds, databases) remain on more capable x86 hardware while Kubernetes workloads run on dedicated ARM nodes.

### Network Design

**Current:** Flat LAN (192.168.8.0/24) with static IP assignments

**Future:** VLAN segmentation is a possibility but not an immediate priority. Focus remains on automation, service reliability, and monitoring before introducing network complexity.

## Why a Homelab?

Cloud platforms are excellent for production workloads, but a physical homelab offers unique learning advantages:

1. **Full control:** Complete access to the infrastructure stack, from hardware to application layer
2. **Real constraints:** Working with limited resources teaches optimization and efficiency
3. **Failure learning:** Safe environment to break things, troubleshoot, and rebuild
4. **Cost-effective:** Using mostly hardware thats already laying around or cheap vs. ongoing cloud costs for experimentation
5. **Hybrid skills:** Experience managing both on-premises and cloud infrastructure

The ultimate goal is cloud competency, with the homelab serving as a proving ground for infrastructure patterns that will be replicated in cloud environments.
